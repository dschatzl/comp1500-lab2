# 3.10 - IF/ELSE
#
# We get the length of a string with the len() function. For example:
# word = 'pythonista'
# length = len(word)

# We say a word is long if it is longer than 12 characters.
# We say a word is short if it is shorter than 4 characters.
# Prompt the user for a word with the prompt "Enter a word: "
# if length of the word is > 12 characters, print "{word} is long".
# elif length of the word is <4 characters, print "{word} is short".
# Otherwise print "{word} is not long or short".
