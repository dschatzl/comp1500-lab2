# 3.2 - IF
# We say a number is "big" if it is > 50.
# Read a number for the user with the prompt 'Enter a number: ' (done for you already here)
# if the number is > 50, print "{number} is a big number".
# Otherwise print nothing

# Note that this is the same as if_big_1.py except that the number the user
# entered appears in the output.

number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
