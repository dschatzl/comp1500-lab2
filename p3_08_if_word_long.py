# We get the length of a string with the len() function. For example:
# word = 'pythonista'
# length = len(word)

# We say a word is long if it is longer than 12 characters.
# Prompt the user for a word with the prompt "Enter a word: " (done for you already here)
# If length of the word is > 12 characters, print "{word} is long".
# Otherwise print nothing.
